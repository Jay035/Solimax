      <p>
        Menzy is a passive move-to-earn project with additional features such as
        compete to earn and activity classification based on machine vision.
        These segments each contain reward mechanisms that grant users MNZ
        tokens once activated as per the segmentation classes as well as the sub
        categories. With Menzyâ€™s Move2Earn; you can earn passively by just
        walking, running and participating in other real world sports and
        activities. This enables a whole new paradigm for wallets where a wallet
        can keep increasing total assets over time while still being used for
        all other utilities: 1) Showcase your skills and earn income in the form
        of MNZ Tokens by competing with other holders in different real world
        physical sports, games and activities. Menzy uses its AI based computer
        vision software that acts as a referee to assess your performance. 2)
        Ensure a healthy living by targeting your daily step count goals on the
        Menzy application and getting rewarded with MNZ tokens and unique
        digital assets for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. MENZY ECOSYSTEM
